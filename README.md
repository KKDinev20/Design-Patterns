1. Strategy Pattern
Theory
The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It enables a client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime. Strategy pattern decouples the code that uses the algorithm from the code that implements the algorithm.

Use case: Situations where multiple algorithms (or behaviors) can be chosen at runtime, such as different sorting algorithms, payment processing methods, or pricing strategies.
